I am **Waleed Ahmed**, a recent Software Engineering graduate from the **National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST)**. I am currently working at **Huawei Pakistan**, where I'm applying my technical skills and passion for innovation in the telecommunications and technology sector.

## Current Focus

I am passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Software Development**. My journey in technology has been driven by curiosity, creativity, and a relentless drive to innovate and solve real-world problems using cutting-edge technologies.

During my academic journey, I had the privilege of working as a **Research Assistant** at the **TUKL-NUST Deep Learning Lab**, where I gained valuable experience in **Explainable AI (X-AI)** for automated EEG interpretation. This experience deepened my understanding of making AI more transparent, trustworthy, and human-interpretable.

## Professional Journey

My transition from academia to industry at Huawei Pakistan represents an exciting new chapter where I'm contributing to cutting-edge telecommunications technology and expanding my expertise in enterprise-level software development.

## Research Interests

- **Explainable AI (X-AI)** and interpretable machine learning
