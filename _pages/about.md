<p>
I‚Äôm <b>Waleed Ahmed</b>, a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher with a deep interest in applying artificial intelligence to real-world problems‚Äîparticularly (but not limited to) healthcare, agriculture, and robotics.<br><br>
I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from <a href="https://nust.edu.pk/" target="_blank">National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)</a>, Pakistan‚Äôs top-ranked university, where I developed a strong foundation in AI and led several impactful research and engineering projects. My academic and research journey has been centered around building AI systems that are not only high-performing but also transparent, trustworthy, and socially beneficial.<br><br>
During my undergrad, I worked on multiple computer vision and machine learning projects and had the opportunity to pursue a fully funded international research internship as a <b>MITACS Globalink Research Intern</b> at <a href="https://www.dal.ca/" target="_blank">Dalhousie University</a> in Canada, where I led a project on contactless cattle recognition using deep learning and image-based techniques. My final year undergrad project, associated with the <a href="https://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk/" target="_blank">TUKL-NUST Deep Learning Lab</a>, focused on Explainable AI for automated EEG interpretation‚Äîa multidisciplinary project combining deep learning with concept-based interpretability to support neurological diagnosis and generate human-interpretable, trustworthy automated EEG reports.<br><br>
Beyond research, I‚Äôve actively sought out global competitions, leadership roles, and volunteer opportunities that challenged me to grow technically and professionally. My work has been recognized at international platforms such as the Huawei ICT Global Finals, and I‚Äôve contributed to projects in domains spanning medical AI, geospatial prediction, intelligent chat systems, and pose estimation. I am also socially active and find it rewarding to help my peers and juniors, and I volunteer to the best of my capacity for social good.
</p>

<h2>üéØ Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>
<span style="color: #d32f2f; font-weight: bold;">
I am currently seeking graduate school opportunities for Spring 2026 (or upcoming intakes) where I can further develop my research interests in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and related fields.
</span><br><br>
I hope to bring my background in applied AI, my international research experience, and a strong work ethic to a graduate program where I can contribute meaningfully to ongoing projects, collaborate with world-class researchers, and grow within a vibrant academic environment.<br><br>
If you‚Äôre part of a research lab or academic team working in these domains, I would love to connect and explore how I can contribute and grow with your group.<br><br>
I pride myself on being well-rounded, having worked in multicultural teams, and always seeking out opportunities that foster both personal and professional growth.
</p>

<h2>üå± Personal Philosophy</h2>
<p>
I believe in <b>‚ÄúLearning while HOPING & HUSTLING!‚Äù</b>‚Äîa mindset that drives me to continuously grow, take on new challenges, and contribute meaningfully to the technology landscape. I value curiosity, collaboration, and a commitment to making a positive impact through technology and community engagement.
